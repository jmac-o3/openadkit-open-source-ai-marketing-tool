      { tactic: "Use Phrase or Exact match for new campaigns", why: "Broad match without Smart Bidding burns budget on tangential queries.", expected_savings: "20-40% wasted spend", effort: "low" },
      { tactic: "Schedule ads during your best conversion hours only", why: "Conversion rate often varies 3-5× by time of day. Off-hours = empty spend.", expected_savings: "10-25%", effort: "low" },
      { tactic: "Exclude mobile apps from Display Network", why: "Mobile app placements are the largest waste source on GDN — accidental clicks dominate.", expected_savings: "30-60% on Display", effort: "low" },

      { tactic: "Improve Quality Score by 2 points on top spenders", why: "QS 5 → 7 typically reduces CPC 16-28% per Google's own data.", expected_savings: "Up to 28% per keyword", effort: "medium" },
      { tactic: "Pause keywords with > 50 clicks and 0 conversions", why: "Statistical confidence that this term doesn't convert. Pull it.", expected_savings: "5-15%", effort: "low" },
      { tactic: "Use single-theme ad groups (≤ 15 closely related keywords)", why: "Tighter themes → higher Quality Score → lower CPC.", expected_savings: "10-20%", effort: "medium" },

      { tactic: "Suppress your customer list from cold campaigns", why: "Upload Customer Match → exclude from prospecting audiences.", expected_savings: "5-12%", effort: "low" },
      { tactic: "Kill ad sets in Learning Limited status after 14 days", why: "Below 50 conversions/week = algorithm can't optimize → CPA inflates.", expected_savings: "Loss containment", effort: "low" },
      { tactic: "Set frequency cap to 2-3 per 7 days on retargeting", why: "Past 3, return curve flattens, ad fatigue + brand-damage risk grows.", expected_savings: "10-20% retargeting spend", effort: "low" },
      { tactic: "Use lookalike 1% from paying customers, not all signups", why: "Seed quality > seed size. 500 paying > 50,000 newsletter signups.", expected_savings: "15-30% on prospecting CPA", effort: "medium" },

    name: "TikTok Ads",
    tips: [
      { tactic: "Scale aggressively when hook rate > 30%", why: "Hook rate is the leading indicator. Above 30% means the algorithm wants to give you more reach.", expected_savings: "Cheaper CPMs at scale", effort: "low" },

      { tactic: "Test with $20-50/day per ad before scaling", why: "TikTok learning needs less data than Meta. Don't over-commit on day 1.", expected_savings: "Test cost containment", effort: "low" },
