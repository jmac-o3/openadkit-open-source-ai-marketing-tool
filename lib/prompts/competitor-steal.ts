${PRICING_PSYCHOLOGY}

INPUT:
- Our product: ${input.our_product}
- Our USP / differentiator: ${input.our_usp}
- Competitor: ${input.competitor_name}
- Platform: ${input.platform}
- Competitor ads (pasted from public Ads Library / Transparency Center / Creative Center):
"""
${input.competitor_ads_pasted}
"""

PART 1 — TEARDOWN

For each competitor ad supplied, extract:
- **Angle** — pain | outcome | social_proof | curiosity | comparison | urgency | identity | contrarian
- **Hook formula** — name the structural device (POV / question / shocking stat / before-after / etc.)
- **Promise / claim** — the specific thing they're saying you get
- **Proof** — what evidence they cite (testimonials, numbers, named entities, demos, none)
- **Emotional trigger** — fear / pride / FOMO / aspiration / belonging
- **CTA mechanic** — soft (learn more) / medium (sign up) / hard (buy now)
- **Weakness** — the lever they DIDN'T pull, the angle they MISSED, the claim that's vague, the proof that's missing

PART 2 — PATTERN RECOGNITION

Across all the competitor ads:
- Which angle do they repeat? (Tells you what's working for them.)
- Which angles do they completely AVOID? (That's your opening.)
- Which proof types do they over-use? (You can flip to a different proof type.)
- What's the dominant emotional register? (You can stand out by going the opposite.)

PART 3 — POSITIONING ATTACK PLAN

Given OUR USP ("${input.our_usp}"), the highest-ROI positioning is:
- What we should CLAIM that they can't match
- What we should PROVE differently
- What angle we should own (one they're not running)
- What hook formula they're not using

PART 4 — BEAT THEIR AD

Write 3 variants that beat the strongest competitor ad shown:
- Variant A — DIRECT FLANK: same angle, sharper claim + stronger proof
- Variant B — DIFFERENT ANGLE: a missing angle from Part 2, anchored to our USP
- Variant C — CONTRARIAN: the opposite emotional register or counter-frame

Each variant: hook + body + CTA, suitable for ${input.platform}, char-validated for that platform's primary text field.

RULES:
- Never copy competitor claims verbatim — that's plagiarism AND policy risk.
- Never make claims our USP doesn't support — that's policy and trust risk.
- If a competitor claim is unsubstantiated, flag it AND don't echo it.
- Cite competitor by name in the teardown only — never in the beat-their-ad variants.
- **CRITICAL: You have NO live access to any ad library, transparency center, or social platform.** Only analyze the ads that appear inside the """fenced block""" above. If that block is empty, contains only a brand name, or contains <50 chars of ad copy, return EXACTLY this JSON (do not invent ads, do not roleplay seeing ads): {"teardown":[],"pattern_recognition":{},"positioning_attack_plan":{},"beat_their_ad":[],"error":"No ad copy was pasted. Open the ad libraries linked above, copy real ads, and paste them so I can analyze actual creative — I cannot fetch ads myself."}

Return ONLY valid JSON:
