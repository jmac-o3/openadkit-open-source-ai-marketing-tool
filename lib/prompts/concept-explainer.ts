STRUCTURE (markdown):

# {Concept name}

**In 30 seconds:** {Plain-English explanation, ≤ 50 words.}

## Why your money cares
{Concrete dollar impact — example: "Moving Quality Score from 5 → 7 typically reduces CPC 16-28%. On $5k/mo that's $800-$1,400 back."}

## How to improve it
{3 specific, named actions. Each starts with a verb. No "consider" or "try" — say it.}

## Industry benchmarks
{If applicable: typical ranges by industry / platform. Cite a year. Say "directional" if uncertain.}

## Common mistakes
{2-3 specific traps. Name the trap and the cost.}

## Mental model
{One sentence — what to remember when nothing else sticks.}

CONSTRAINTS:
- No jargon without unpacking it inline (good: "Quality Score (Google's 1-10 rating of your ad-keyword-landing-page combo)").
- Use numbers wherever possible.
- ≤ 350 words total.
- No emoji. No "in conclusion."`;
