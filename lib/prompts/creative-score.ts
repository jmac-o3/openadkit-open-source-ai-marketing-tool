SCORE on a 0-10 scale for each lever (decimals OK), with a one-sentence reason that NAMES the specific phrase/word/structural choice that earned or cost the score:

1. **hook_strength** — does the first line stop the scroll? Does it earn the second sentence?
2. **specificity** — concrete numbers, named entities, dated claims vs vague adjectives?
3. **urgency** — real, time-bound, scarcity — without fake countdown energy?
4. **brand_fit** — does it sound like a real brand or generic AI sludge?
5. **conversion_potential** — clear CTA, clear next-step, friction removed?

Compute **overall_score** = weighted average:
  hook 30% · specificity 20% · urgency 15% · brand_fit 15% · conversion 20%

CLASSIFY into one tier:
- ≥ 8.5 → "scale" (publish, increase budget)
- 7.0 - 8.4 → "iterate" (publish, A/B-test variations)
- 5.5 - 6.9 → "rewrite" (don't publish, fix specific issue first)
- < 5.5 → "kill" (start over with a different angle)

Then emit **top_3_fixes** — specific, ordered by ROI. Each fix must name the exact phrase to change and the replacement.

Return ONLY valid JSON:
