${PRICING_PSYCHOLOGY}

INPUT — page:
- URL: ${input.landing_page_url || "(not provided)"}
- Audience: ${input.audience}
- Primary conversion goal: ${input.primary_goal || "(not specified)"}

INPUT — the ad's promise (what the visitor clicked thinking they'd find):
"${input.ad_promise}"

INPUT — landing page copy:
"""
${(input.landing_copy ?? "").slice(0, 24_000)}
"""

INPUT — performance data:
- Visitors / period: ${input.visitors || "(not provided)"}
- Conversions: ${input.conversions || "(not provided)"}
- Bounce rate: ${input.bounce_rate || "(not provided)"}
- Avg time on page: ${input.time_on_page || "(not provided)"}
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): ${input.lcp || "(not provided)"}
- Mobile traffic %: ${input.mobile_pct || "(not provided)"}

${input.lp_screenshot ? `IMAGE ATTACHED:
The user has dropped a full-page screenshot. JUDGE THE VISUAL HIERARCHY directly:
- Is the H1 above the fold and the largest type on the page?
- Is the primary CTA visible without scrolling, and clearly the strongest button?
- Does the hero visual support or compete with the message?
- Are there competing CTAs on the same screen?
- Above-the-fold: H1 + subhead + visual + CTA all present?
Cite "(from screenshot)" in scores or fixes when the image — not the typed copy — drove the call.
When typed copy and image conflict, trust the image (it's the live page).

` : ""}PHASE 1 — COMPUTE THE NUMBERS:
- Conversion rate = conversions / visitors × 100 (2dp).
- Bounce-vs-benchmark: typical paid LP bounce rate 50-70%. Flag if >75% (very high) or <40% (suspiciously low, likely tracking issue).
- LCP verdict: ≤ 2.5s = good · 2.5-4s = needs improvement · > 4s = poor (also hurts Google QS).
- Engagement health: < 20s time-on-page = abandoned · 20-45s = scanning · > 45s = engaged.
- If a metric can't be computed, mark "could not be computed" — NEVER invent.

PHASE 2 — DIAGNOSE MESSAGE MATCH (the #1 lever):
- Does the H1 echo the ad's promise within 5 words of the same idea?
- Is the visitor "yes-this-is-the-right-place" within 3 seconds of landing?
- High bounce + low time-on-page + weak message match = the diagnosis is settled before scoring anything else.

PHASE 3 — SCORE 1-10 EACH LEVER, with a NAMED reason (no vague verdicts):
- message_match: H1 echoes ad promise?
- clarity: stranger knows what's being sold in 5 seconds?
- cta_effectiveness: ONE primary CTA, visible above the fold, action-led verb?
- social_proof: real numbers, named entities, dated reviews — NOT "trusted by thousands"?
- specificity: ONE concrete benefit with a number?
- objection_handling: acknowledges & rebuts top 2 objections?
- friction: anything adding drag (long form, competing CTAs, unclear pricing)?
- above_the_fold: H1 + subhead + visual + CTA all visible without scroll on mobile?

PHASE 4 — RANK FIXES:
For each lever scored ≤ 6, write a SPECIFIC fix — quote the exact phrase to change and write the replacement. Order all fixes by expected impact (high → low). Anchor expected_impact to the computed metrics ("Bounce rate 76% + time 14s + message_match score 3 → message_match fix expected_impact=high").

PHASE 5 — TWO ONE-LINERS:
- biggest_problem: the single specific thing killing performance, named.
- biggest_opportunity: the single specific change that lifts conversion most.

PHASE 6 — ABOVE-THE-FOLD REWRITE:
Write a tight rewrite of H1 + subhead + 3 bullets + CTA button. Validate char counts as listed in the JSON schema.
