export function buildHashtagPrompt(input: HashtagInput): string {
  return `Generate a tiered hashtag strategy for: "${input.title}"
Platform: ${input.platform}
Language: ${input.language}
Context: ${input.context || "(not provided)"}

LANGUAGE RULES:
- Generate hashtags in ${input.language}.
- If ${input.language} uses a non-Latin script (Hindi, Arabic, Japanese, etc.), include BOTH the native-script version AND a romanized/transliterated variant for cross-platform reach.
- Where there's a widely-used English equivalent (#travel, #fashion), include that too for discovery — clearly labeled.

PLATFORM RULES (apply the ones relevant to ${input.platform}):
- Instagram: ~30 hashtag soft limit, broad+niche+branded mix wins
- TikTok: 3-5 hashtags optimal — over-tagging dilutes algorithm signal
- Twitter/X: 1-2 max — more than 2 drops engagement measurably
- LinkedIn: 3-5 professional hashtags; avoid emoji-style tags
- YouTube: up to 15 in description; first 3 most weighted
- Pinterest: 20 max but quality over quantity
- "any": cover all platform sizes — output is a master list, user picks

TIERS (return all four):

1. **Broad / discovery** (millions of posts) — for top-of-funnel reach
2. **Medium / topical** (100k - 1M posts) — sweet spot for actual visibility
3. **Niche / micro-community** (under 100k) — highest engagement rates, lowest competition
4. **Branded / campaign-specific** — your own brand tag(s) the audience could adopt

RULES:
- No spaces, no special chars except _ where allowed.
- Lowercase by default — some platforms prefer CamelCase for accessibility (#BlackFriday vs #blackfriday) — include both versions for the top tier.
- No banned/shadow-banned tags. Common banned examples include overused engagement-bait tags like #followme #like4like #f4f — never include these.
- Branded tags should match the brand from context; if no brand provided, suggest tag patterns based on the title.
- DO NOT generate hashtags about restricted topics (illegal substances, weapons, hate, adult content).

HASHTAG-VOLUME RULE (most important — read carefully):
You do NOT have live access to current hashtag post counts. Stating "10M+ posts" or "850k posts" as a fact is fabrication. Use the "volume_estimate" enum below instead — it captures the tier without inventing precision:
- "high"    → broadly used, 1M+ posts (use for top-of-funnel discovery tags)
- "mid"     → moderately used, ~100k–1M (use for the bulk of your post mix)
- "low"     → niche, < ~100k (use for engaged-community tags)
- "unknown" → you genuinely don't know, do not guess
