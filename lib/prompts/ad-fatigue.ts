INPUT — weekly performance (week 1 vs latest week):

${input.fatigue_screenshot ? `IMAGE ATTACHED:
The user has dropped a performance graph (Meta delivery insights / TikTok analytics / Google Display).
Read the trend lines directly: frequency arc, CTR slope, CPM slope, conversion fall-off. Cite "(from
screenshot)" when the image — not the typed numbers — drives a severity call.

` : ""}PHASE 1 — COMPUTE THE DECAY %s:
- reach_decay = (impressions_week_latest / impressions_week_1) − 1 → as percentage
- ctr_decay = (ctr_latest − ctr_week_1) / ctr_week_1 → as percentage (negative means decay)
- cpm_creep = (cpm_latest − cpm_week_1) / cpm_week_1 → as percentage
- conversion_decay = (conv_latest − conv_week_1) / conv_week_1 → as percentage

For each: if both weeks aren't provided, mark "could not be computed" — never invent.

PHASE 2 — SCORE EACH FATIGUE SIGNAL (0-10, with named reading + threshold-breached flag):
- frequency: Meta target ceiling 3.0 (warning), 5.0 (severe). TikTok: 2.5 (warning). Google Display: 6.0.
  Score = how far over target × intensity. threshold_breached = true if at/above the warning line.
- ctr_decay: 0-15% decay = mild · 15-25% moderate · 25-40% high · >40% severe.
- cpm_increase: 0-10% = mild · 10-20% moderate · >20% severe (especially when reach is also dropping).
- creative_lifespan: typical burnout windows — TikTok 7-10 days · Meta 14-21 days · Google Display
  30+ days · YouTube 21-30 days. Score on days_running vs platform-typical window.

PHASE 3 — OVERALL SEVERITY:
none = no threshold breached AND <10% CTR decay AND frequency <2
mild = 1 signal mild
moderate = 2+ signals at or past warning OR CTR decay 25-40%
severe = freq at severe line OR CTR decay >40% OR negative_feedback below_average + cost climbing

Provide a severity_reason that names the breached signals + the specific numbers.

PHASE 4 — PRESCRIBE 3 REFRESH OPTIONS, ranked by effort:

LOW EFFORT (1-2 hours):
- Reorder hook · swap opening visual · adjust thumbnail · change CTA verb

MEDIUM EFFORT (half-day):
- Same offer, new angle · native variant (UGC retread) · new B-roll cut · new music

HIGH EFFORT (1-2 days):
- New offer · new creator (TikTok/UGC) · new positioning · new audience expansion

Each item: { action, specific_change (concrete, copy-paste actionable), expected_lift (directional %) }.

PHASE 5 — NEW ANGLES TO TEST (5):
Pick angles the current ad ISN'T pulling — anchored to the brand brain's audience_pain_points + audience_desires.

PHASE 6 — KILL THRESHOLD:
A concrete rule the user can apply weekly (e.g. "if frequency > 4 and CTR < 0.5% for 3+ days, kill and replace").
