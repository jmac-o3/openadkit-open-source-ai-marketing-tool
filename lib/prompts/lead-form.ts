NATIVE LEAD FORM RULES (cross-platform):
- Every additional question drops conversion 5-10%. Ask the MINIMUM that lets sales follow up.
- Pre-fillable fields (name, email, phone, company) cost less than custom questions.
- Custom questions should be QUALIFYING — not "what's your favorite color".
- Multiple-choice beats free-text for completion rate; free-text beats nothing.

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC LIMITS:
- Meta Instant Form: up to 15 questions, recommend ≤ 5. Intro headline ≤ 60 chars. Greeting ≤ 280 chars.
- LinkedIn Lead Gen Form: up to 12 questions, recommend ≤ 4. Headline ≤ 70. Intro ≤ 70. Privacy text required.
- Google Lead Form Extension: up to 10 questions, headline ≤ 30, description ≤ 200.
- TikTok Instant Form: up to 10 questions, intro headline ≤ 50.

INPUT:
- Platform: ${input.platform}
- Offer the lead is signing up for: ${input.offer}
- Audience role: ${input.audience_role}
- What we'll do with the lead: ${input.what_we_do_with_lead}
- Sales motion: ${input.sales_motion}

GENERATE:
1. Intro headline + greeting (platform-appropriate length, front-load the value).
2. Questions array — minimum viable to qualify for sales motion. If self_serve, 2-3 questions max. If high_touch, 4-5 with at least one BANT-flavored qualifier.
3. Privacy policy line (placeholder URL).
4. Thank-you screen — what does the lead see immediately? What CTA shows up next?
5. Auto-responder email subject + 3-line body (calendly placeholder, expectation set).
6. Sales handoff brief — what info gets passed to sales/CRM, in what shape.
