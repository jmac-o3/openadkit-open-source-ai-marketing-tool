${input.search_terms_screenshot ? `IMAGE ATTACHED:
The user has dropped a screenshot of their Search Terms report. Extract each visible row:
query · impressions · clicks · CTR · conversions · cost · added/excluded status. Use this
EXACTLY as if it were pasted text. When typed text and image conflict, trust the image.
Cite "(from screenshot)" in search_terms_analysis when image data drove a recommendation.

` : ""}PHASE 1 — ANALYZE THE SEARCH TERMS REPORT (the highest-leverage step):
If search_terms_report is provided (or visible in screenshot), compute:
  - WASTE: total spend on queries with 0 conversions for ≥ X clicks (X depends on CPA target — 2× target CPA worth of clicks with zero conversions = clear waste).
  - HIGH-INTENT QUERIES: those that converted at or below target CPA. These deserve their own exact-match keyword + tighter ad group.
  - ZERO-CLICK QUERIES: high impressions but 0-1 clicks → ad copy/relevance issue OR a negative-keyword candidate.
  - MATCH-TYPE GAPS: queries triggering broad match keywords that should be promoted to phrase/exact, OR triggering exact-match terms that are too restrictive (broad-match opportunities for Smart Bidding accounts).
  - INTENT MISCLASSIFICATIONS: queries the ad shouldn't be matching at all (different audience, wrong product). Those become NEGATIVES, not new keywords.

PHASE 2 — BUILD THE KEYWORD LIST:
1. Map each new keyword to its intent stage:
   - informational (top of funnel, learning)
   - commercial_investigation (mid: comparing, evaluating)
   - transactional (bottom: ready to act)
   - branded (own brand + competitor brand)
   - navigational (specific products/SKUs)
2. Match-type rules:
   - Use PHRASE or EXACT for transactional terms (waste-control)
   - Use BROAD only if paired with Smart Bidding AND a strong negative list
   - Branded campaigns: exact match
3. Promote any high-intent query from the Search Terms report to its own exact-match keyword.

PHASE 3 — NEGATIVE KEYWORDS:
- 10-15 negatives derived FROM the search-terms data when provided (each one has a "reason" field referencing the query it came from). When data is not provided, fall back to inference-based negatives but mark reason="inferred".
- Include obvious irrelevance ("free", "DIY", "jobs", "salary" when these would dilute the ad).

PHASE 4 — AD GROUP STRUCTURE:
Group keywords by tightly-themed intent clusters (single-theme ad groups — 5-15 keywords each).
Adjacency principle: queries that would trigger the same ad text belong in the same ad group.

PHASE 5 — LONG-TAIL + COMPETITOR GAPS:
- 5-8 long-tail (4+ word, clear intent, lower CPC) — prefer ones that surfaced as good performers in Search Terms.
- 3-5 competitor keyword gaps — what competitors are likely bidding on that the user isn't (informed by competitor list + market).

PHASE 6 — BIDDING STRATEGY based on conversion volume:
- < 15 conv/month: Manual CPC + bid adjustments. Smart Bidding will misfire on thin data.
- 15-49 conv/month: ECPC (Enhanced CPC) — soft Smart Bidding.
- 50+ conv/month + target CPA defined: Target CPA.
- 50+ conv/month + revenue tracking: Target ROAS.
- New campaign with 0 conversion history: Maximize Clicks for 7 days, then switch.
