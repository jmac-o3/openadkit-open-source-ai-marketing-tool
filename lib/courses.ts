Most beginners think the highest bidder wins. That's wrong. Google ranks ads by **Ad Rank**, which is roughly:

> Ad Rank = max CPC bid × Quality Score × (expected extension impact)

Quality Score is Google's 1–10 rating of how relevant your ad is to the user's query, the user's expected click experience, and the landing page experience.

**Why it matters in dollars**: a competitor with bid $2.00 and QS 6 has Ad Rank 12. You can beat them with bid $1.50 and QS 9 (Ad Rank 13.5) — and you'll pay LESS per click because Google's CPC formula is:

> Actual CPC = (Ad Rank of ad below you / your Quality Score) + $0.01

Lower your QS, you pay more even at the same bid. Raise it, you pay less.

**The lever you control**: Quality Score. Bidding is a brute-force lever. Quality Score is the leverage lever.`,

Account (one billing identity)

          └─ Ads (3+ ads per group; Google rotates and learns)

\`\`\`

**The single biggest beginner mistake**: cramming "running shoes", "marathon training plan", "best protein powder", and "yoga mats" into one ad group. Quality Score collapses because no single ad copy can be relevant to all those queries.

**Fix it**: one ad group per intent cluster. "Trail running shoes for women" deserves its own ad group with its own headline. So does "minimalist running shoes for beginners."

**Broad match**: matches queries Google's algorithm thinks are RELATED, including synonyms, misspellings, and "similar searches." Largest reach, biggest waste risk.

**Rule of thumb**: don't use Broad unless paired with Smart Bidding (tCPA / tROAS / Maximize Conversions) AND a robust negative-keyword list. Smart Bidding can prune the bad matches; manual CPC cannot.

Google Ads has three ways to track conversions:

1. **Google Ads conversion tag** — JS pixel on your thank-you/confirmation page.
2. **Google Analytics 4 → Google Ads import** — bring conversions defined in GA4 into Ads.
3. **Server-side / Enhanced Conversions** — for accuracy under cookie loss.

**Pick at least one. Two is better.** Without conversion data:
- Smart Bidding has nothing to optimize toward → wasted spend
- You can't see CPA → you can't know if a campaign is profitable
- OpenAdKit's /optimize/budget will refuse to give specific recommendations (it has a STOP condition for "tracking not verified")

**Setup checklist**:
- [ ] Conversion action created in Ads
- [ ] Conversion value defined (use dynamic value for ecom, static for leads)
- [ ] Attribution model chosen (data-driven is the default now)
- [ ] Conversion window set (30 days click / 1 day view typical)
- [ ] Enhanced Conversions enabled if you have any email data on the thank-you page

| Target ROAS (tROAS) | 50 | maximize revenue | ecommerce with revenue tracking |
| Maximize Conversion Value | 30 | grow revenue | ecom without strict ROAS target |

**The mistake**: enabling tCPA on a campaign with 10 conversions/month. The algorithm doesn't have enough signal to optimize → results get worse before they get better, then you panic, then you switch back. Don't.

**Graduation path**: Manual → ECPC → MaxConv → tCPA → tROAS. Each step gates on conversion volume.

**Lookalike audiences**: feed Meta a list of your best customers (or top 1% of website visitors) and ask it to find similar people. 1% is tightest; 5% is broader. 1% rarely beats 3% — and 10% is usually no better than broad.

- All newsletter signups (mostly tire-kickers)
- All "engaged users" (likes/comments are not commercial intent)
- Cold lead lists you imported (these people don't act like your customers)

- The rule: increase by 15-30% per change, no more often than every 3-4 days. Bigger jumps reset learning.
- Eventually hits a ceiling — the audience saturates, frequency climbs, CPA grows.

**Horizontal scaling**: duplicating winners into new audiences (new lookalikes, new interest stacks, new geos).

- The right move when: vertical is hitting saturation, OR you've validated the creative and want to multiply reach.
- The rule: clone the ad set, change only the audience, restart learning. Expect each new audience to take 7-14 days to stabilize.
- Risk: each clone takes time + budget to learn. Don't clone into 5 new audiences at once if you can't afford 5 learning phases simultaneously.

**The hybrid**: scale vertically until CPA drifts up 15%, then start horizontal. Repeat.`,

On Meta, polished creative often wins. On TikTok, polished creative often LOSES. The platform rewards content that looks like every other organic post.

**Why**: TikTok users opt into the feed expecting entertainment, not commerce. Anything that screams "ad" gets thumbed past in 0.4 seconds. Polished production tells the brain "this is an ad."

**The implication**: TikTok creative production is closer to a creator workflow than an agency workflow. UGC > studio shoots. Phone footage > cinema cameras. Casual voiceover > polished VO talent.

**The numbers**: TikTok engagement rate averages 5-16% (vs Meta Feed ~1.2%, Meta Stories ~0.7%). CPMs are 40-60% cheaper than Meta on most verticals. But only if the creative is native.`,

TikTok's For You Page algorithm scores every video — organic AND paid — on:
- **Completion rate** (watched to the end)
- **Loop rate** (watched twice)
- **Engagement rate** (likes, comments, shares, saves)
- **Watch time per impression**

**Signal compression**: TikTok decides whether to promote your video aggressively within 500-1000 impressions. If hook rate (3-second view rate) is below ~30%, the algorithm caps distribution. You can spend more — but you're force-feeding a bad video to a paid audience.

**The implication**: your hook (first 1.5-2 seconds) is the single most important asset. Test 10 hooks for every 1 body-of-video you produce.

**Hook formulas that work**:
- "POV: [unexpected scenario]"
- "Stop scrolling if you [target audience pain]"
- "I tried [thing] for 30 days, here's what happened"
- "The reason your [X] isn't working"

- "POV: you're a marketing manager who just inherited a broken Meta account…"

**3. Specificity / contrarian claim** — a specific number or counterintuitive statement.
- "I made $14k in November from one app — and it took me 4 hours total."
- "Stop spending on TikTok ads. Spend on creators instead. Here's the math."

3. **Show-don't-tell list** — what they should physically demonstrate, in their own way.
4. **Do-not list** — things that will get the post rejected (claims you can't substantiate, sensitive language, competitor mentions).
5. **A reference video** — link to one organic post they made that's the closest match to the tone you want.
6. **Compliance line** — required disclosure language (FTC, TikTok policy).

**What a good brief does NOT contain**:
- A line-by-line script
- Brand voice guidelines
- A storyboard
- Multiple optional CTAs
- Restrictions that override their creative voice (e.g. "must use these exact words")

**TopView** — full-screen takeover on app launch. Premium pricing. Use only for product launches, tentpole campaigns, or major announcements. Day-one impression cost is high but lifetime brand impact can justify it.

**Branded Hashtag Challenge** — user-generated content campaign around a hashtag. Massive scale (1M+ video creations possible). $100k+ minimum, agency lift required. Skip unless you have the budget AND the cultural moment.

**Watch-through rate** at 25%, 50%, 75% — tells you where the video loses viewers. If 25% holds but 50% craters, you've got a "middle problem." If 25% itself craters, hook is bad.

**CTR (link clicks / impressions)** — secondary. Useful, not deterministic. A video with 5% hook rate and 1.5% CTR can outperform a video with 2% hook rate and 2.5% CTR because the first scales further.

**CVR (conversions / clicks)** — landing-page problem, not ad problem.

**CPA** — the only thing that matters at the end of the day.

- Days 1-2: learning, performance volatile
- Days 3-7: peak, scale daily budget here
- Days 8-10: fatigue creep — frequency climbs, CPA drifts up
- Day 10+: kill or refresh

**Implication**: you can't ride one TikTok winner the way you can ride a Meta winner. You need a CREATIVE PIPELINE. Most accounts that win at TikTok long-term are producing 4-10 new creatives per week.

**Scaling moves**:
1. **Vertical**: raise daily budget 30-50% per change every 24-48 hours on a winner. (Faster than Meta because creative lifespan is shorter — you don't have time to be cautious.)
2. **Horizontal**: clone the winning concept with a DIFFERENT creator or different hook. Same body, new top-of-funnel.
3. **Spark variants**: if the winner is creator-led, ask the creator for 2-3 alternate hooks for the same body.
