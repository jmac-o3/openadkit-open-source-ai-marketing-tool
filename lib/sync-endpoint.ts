/**
 * Single source of truth for the local-sync sidecar's origin.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The sidecar port used to be hardcoded to 3006 in three separate places
 * (lib/local-sync.ts, lib/url-ingest.ts, public/sw.js) while
 * scripts/resolve-ports.cjs actively moved the sidecar to an OS-assigned or
 * hash-derived high-range port on every launch. Result: on a typical install
 * the browser was talking to a port nothing was listening on, so folder sync
 * silently never ran and URL ingest silently skipped its most reliable reader
 * and fell through to rate-limited third parties — while telling the user
 * "is the launcher running?" when it was.
 *
 * The port now flows one way:
 *   resolve-ports.cjs / local-sync.cjs
 *     -> .env.local (ADFORGE_SYNC_PORT + NEXT_PUBLIC_ADFORGE_SYNC_PORT)
 *     -> Next inlines NEXT_PUBLIC_* at build time
 *     -> getSyncOrigin() here
 *     -> every browser-side caller
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at BUILD time, so a port that shifts after the
 * build (a second install claiming the port, a user editing Settings) would
 * still be stale. To cover that we also probe a short candidate list once per
 * session and remember the origin that answered /health. The probe result is
 * cached in sessionStorage so it costs one request per tab, not one per call.
