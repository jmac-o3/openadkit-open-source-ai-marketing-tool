# NOTICE — Sources & Attribution

OpenAdKit is MIT-licensed. The prompts shipped in `lib/prompts/` are informed by — and in some places quote verbatim from — these public, MIT-licensed open-source projects. We list them here both to give credit and so users can trace any rule back to its source.

- **Style transfer via exemplar retrieval** approach (conceptually adapted for browser context) — from `py/copycat/ad_copy_generator.py`
- **Programmatic "fill the gap"** (request only the missing assets, not all of them) — from `py/copycat/copycat.py`

## License compatibility

All borrowed patterns come from MIT or Apache-2.0 licensed sources. OpenAdKit itself is MIT. Verbatim quotes are limited to the **rules and structural patterns**, not the project's code — and we re-write everything in our own prompt voice except where a rule is quoted (like Copycat's combinability clause, which is short, factual, and not creative expression).

If you maintain one of these projects and want different attribution or wish for us to remove a pattern, open an issue at https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/OpenAdKit-Open-Source-AI-Marketing-Tool/issues — we'll respond within 7 days.

## Platform specs

Character limits, ratios, and image sizes referenced in our prompts are cross-confirmed across at least two of the four source repos above AND each platform's official help docs (last verified May 2026 — see `lib/benchmarks.ts` and individual prompt files in `lib/prompts/`).

## Industry benchmarks

Benchmark ranges in `lib/benchmarks.ts` are **directional 2025 industry data**, cross-confirmed across:
- claude-ads benchmark file
- marketingskills paid-ads platform-strengths table
- WordStream annual benchmark reports (publicly cited)
- Each platform's own published advertiser benchmarks

Treat all ranges as directional. Always verify against your own attribution before treating as truth.
